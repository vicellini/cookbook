Wrapped objects may be chained.\n\n  // Helper function to continue chaining intermediate results.\n  var result = function(instance, obj) {\n    return instance._chain ? _(obj).chain() : obj;\n  };\n\n  // Add your own custom functions to the Underscore object.\n  _.mixin = function(obj) {\n    _.each(_.functions(obj), function(name) {\n      var func = _[name] = obj[name];\n      _.prototype[name] = function() {\n        var args = [this._wrapped];\n        push.apply(args, arguments);\n        return result(this, func.apply(_, args));\n      };\n    });\n  };\n\n  // Add all of the Underscore functions to the wrapper object.\n  _.mixin(_);\n\n  // Add all mutator Array functions to the wrapper.\n  _.each(['pop', 'push', 'reverse', 'shift', 'sort', 'splice', 'unshift'], function(name) {\n    var method = ArrayProto[name];\n    _.prototype[name] = function() {\n      var obj = this._wrapped;\n      method.apply(obj, arguments);\n      if ((name === 'shift' || name === 'splice') && obj.length === 0) delete obj[0];\n      return result(this, obj);\n    };\n  });\n\n  // Add all accessor Array functions to the wrapper.\n  _.each(['concat', 'join', 'slice'], function(name) {\n    var method = ArrayProto[name];\n    _.prototype[name] = function() {\n      return result(this, method.apply(this._wrapped, arguments));\n    };\n  });\n\n  // Extracts the result from a wrapped and chained object.\n  _.prototype.value = function() {\n    return this._wrapped;\n  };\n\n  // Provide unwrapping proxy for some methods used in engine operations\n  // such as arithmetic and JSON stringification.\n  _.prototype.valueOf = _.prototype.toJSON = _.prototype.value;\n\n  _.prototype.toString = function() {\n    return '' + this._wrapped;\n  };\n\n  // AMD registration happens at the end for compatibility with AMD loaders\n  // that may not enforce next-turn semantics on modules.

Those cases could generate an error when an\n  // anonymous define() is called outside of a loader request.\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define('underscore', [], function() {\n      return _;\n    });\n  }\n}.call(this));\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/underscore/underscore.js\n// module id = 177\n// module chunks = 0","var g;\r\n\r\n// This works in non-strict mode\r\ng = (function() {\r\n\treturn this;\r\n})();\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n\t// This works if eval is allowed (see CSP)\r\n\tg = g || Function(\"return this\")() || (1,eval)(\"this\");\r\n} catch(e) {\r\n\t// This works if the window reference is available\r\n\tif(typeof window === \"object\")\r\n\t\tg = window;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// g can still be undefined, but nothing to do about it...\r\n// We return undefined, instead of nothing here, so it's\r\n// easier to handle this case. if(!global) { ...}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = g;\r\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// (webpack)/buildin/global.js\n// module id = 178\n// module chunks = 0","import styles from './styles/main.scss'\nimport app from './scripts/app.js'\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src-client/index.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
